### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m a theoretical and computational chemist working in the area of Quantum Chemistry and Molecular Dynamics. I have authored two software packages, DAMQT: For analysis of electron density and electrostatic potential; and FFParam: For force-field parametrization. I have also developed CHARMM-Psi4 interface for QM/MM calculations. DGenFF is my current ongoing project which allows automated parameter generation for Drude Polarizable Force Field. I love simplifying and generalizing important chemical problems and providing a solution to their applications which can benefit science community.
